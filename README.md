All projects for CS188 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, done in collaboration with Shiori Sagawa.

Project 1: Plays Pacman using state space search (BFS, DFS, A*).

Files edited: search.py, searchAgents.py, multiAgent.py

Project 2: Plays Pacman by introducing boolean variables for each time step, then using a satisfiability solver to determine which actions to take.

Files edited: search.py

Project 3: Ghosts are only observable using a noisy sensor, so they are tracked using a dynamic Bayesian network.

Files edited: bustersAgents.py, inference.py

Project 4: Implements reinforcement learning (value iteration, Q-learning) to play Pacman.

Files edited: valueIterationAgents.py, qlearningAgents.py, analysis.py

Project 5: Implements a neural network to play Pacman.

Files edited: qlearningAgents.py, perceptron_pacman.py, perceptron.py, dataClassifier.py
